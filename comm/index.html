<p class="lead">
The GeoServer community utilizes multiple channels of communication. This page should help you find the channel best suited for your needs.

    <h2>Mailing Lists</h2>
    <p>
    Email is the primary form of communication for GeoServer users and developers. Being an 
    open community means that sending email to an individual developer is discouraged. Instead
    all email communication should take place on the email lists. If you have a question
    are chances are someone else has the same question.

    If you are not in position to communicate in public please contact one of our <a href="../support">commercial support</a> vendors.
