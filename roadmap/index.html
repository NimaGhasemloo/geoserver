<h1>Release Schedule</h1>
<section>
<p>
GeoServer releases on a six month cycle providing short turn around time for new features.
</p>
<p>
Each GeoServer release is supported with bug fixes for a year, with releases made approximately every two months. This allows for an overlap between supported releases allowing organisations a chance to migrate without undue pressure.

If your organisation is making use of a GeoServer version that is no longer in use by the community all is not lost. You can volunteer on the developer list to make additional releases.
</p>
<p>
Please see the wiki <a href="{{ site.wiki_url }}/Release-Schedule">GeoTools and GeoServer release schedule </a> for specific versions, or to volunteer to help make a release.

<h1>Future Direction</h1>
<section>
<p>
The future direction of GeoServer is primarily shaped by the constant flow of code contributions and funding directed towards the implementation of new features.
In case you are wondering about a new feature or improvement we have a <a href="{{ site.wiki_url }}/Successfully-requesting-and-integrating-fixes,-improvements-and-new-features-in-GeoServer" >wiki page describing the process to discuss and implement it</a>.

<h1>Planning</h1>
<section>
<p>
As an experiment in 2023 the GeoServer team has shared a roadmap of goals to help coordinate fundraising and planning activities:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="{% post_url 2024-01-03-roadmap %}">GeoServer 2024 Roadmap Planning</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The GeoServer asks for your participation and financial support to reach these goals.
