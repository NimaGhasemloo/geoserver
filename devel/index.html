    <h2>Mailing List</h2>
    <p>
    Email is the primary form of communication for GeoServer developers. Being an 
    open community means that sending email to individual developers is discouraged. Instead
    all email communication should take place on one of the email lists. If you have a question
    are chances are someone else has the same question.

    If you are not in position to communicate in public please contact one of our <a href="../support">commercial support</a> vendors.

        <h3><a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/geoserver-devel">Developer List</a></h3>
        <p>
            This list is for developers to discuss topics related to GeoServer development.
            If you're knee deep in the code it's the place to email. Traffic can be high, as 
            we try to make most all conversations public so people know what's going on.
