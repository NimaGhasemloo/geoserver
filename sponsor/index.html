<h1>GeoServer Sponsorship</h1>
<p class="lead">
    The GeoServer project would like to ask for your financial assistance at this time.
</p>
<p>
    The GeoServer project steering committee seeks an annual budget used to fund maintenance activities, code sprints, and research and development that is beyond the reach of an individual contributor.
    We will also announce <a href="https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/wiki/Sponsor">specific activities</a> throughout the year, being sure to thank sponsors when describing functionality in release notes and presentations.
</p>
<p>
    Sponsorship and associated recognition is an opportunity for the team to thank those who can contribute financially.

    <h4>Donate via PayPal</h4>
    <p>
       Easy for one-time donations and sponsorships (although PayPal takes a small overhead):
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>OSGeo provided a PayPal donate button that goes straight to GeoServer:<br/>
        <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=4XZ76BZMEWZ24&source=url">
          <img src="../img/btn_donateCC_LG.gif" width="147" height="47"/>
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>Check the currency when donating (USD rates are provided by default). <br/>
          <img src="img/paypal-donation.png" width="417"/>
      </li>
      <li>Use the message field to support a specific activity: <br/>
          <img src="img/paypal-message.png" width="417"/>
      </li>
      <li>
         The OSGeo Treasurer will contact both you and the GeoServer PSC to acknowledge your sponsorship.
         <ul>
         <li>Donations: We will ask individuals for their name, and a useful link.</p>
         <li>Sponsorship: We will ask organisations for their logo to be listed on the GeoServer and OSGeo website.</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Donate via GitHub Sponsors</h4>
    <p>
       Great for monthly donations, provides some sponsorship matching, a github sticker, and avoid PayPal overhead:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Visit GitHub Sponsors page for <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/OSGeo">https://github.com/sponsors/OSGeo</a>
      </li>
      <li>Select a monthly donation sponsorship tier.<br/>
          <img src="img/github-tier.png" width="417"/>
      </li>
      <li>
         The OSGeo Treasurer does not get a clear notification from Github, so we have to ask you to send an email to
         <a href="mailto:treasurer@osgeo.org?subject=Setting up GeoServer Sponsorship&body=I have used GitHub Sponsors page to setup a monthly donation of $50 to the GeoServer project.%0d%0aPlease see attached logo for OSGeo Bronze sponsorship level.">
               treasurer@osgeo.org
         </a>:
         <ul>
         <li>Donations: Individuals are asked to include your name, and a useful link, for GeoServer website.</p>
         <li>Sponsorship: Organisations are asked to include their logo and website URL to be listed on the GeoServer and OSGeo websites.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
           Example email sponsoring GeoServer:
         </p>
         <blockquote>
           <p>Subject: Setting up GeoServer sponsorship</p>
           <p>To: treasurer@osgeo.org</p>
 
           <p>Treasurer:</p>
