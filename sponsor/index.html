<h1>GeoServer Sponsorship</h1>
<p class="lead">
    The GeoServer project would like to ask for your financial assistance at this time.
</p>
<p>
    The GeoServer project steering committee seeks an annual budget used to fund maintenance activities, code sprints, and research and development that is beyond the reach of an individual contributor.
    We will also announce specific activities throughout the year, being sure to thank sponsors when describing functionality in release notes and presentations.
</p>
<p>
    Sponsorship and associated recognition is an opportunity for the team to thank those who can contribute financially.
