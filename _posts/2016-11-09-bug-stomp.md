**Save the Date:** The next GeoServer "Bug Stomp" is scheduled for Nov 18th!

If you would like to take part, but are new to open source development, please join the [GeoServer-Devel](http://geoserver.org/comm/) email list and introduce yourself. We would like to ensure everyone shows up with a working test/development environment - and access to the "gitter" chat. Getting setup before the event gives everyone a chance to work as a team.

Please join us on Friday November 18th,  all skill levels welcome. Open source is not a spectator sport.

### About GeoServer Bug Stomp


GeoServer is hosting monthly "Bug Stomps", giving the developer community a chance to focus on the health of the project, tackle difficult problems and introduce new developers to the team.

In October we have 117 issues closed - with 17 of those marked as fixed.

[![bugstomp](http://blog.geoserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/bugstomp.png)](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/secure/ConfigureReport.jspa?projectOrFilterId=project-10000&periodName=daily&daysprevious=30&cumulative=true&versionLabels=all&selectedProjectId=10000&reportKey=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.reports%3Acreatedvsresolved-report)

Highlights include:



 	
  * The REST API for services [displays boolean yes/no settings](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-7822) correctly

 	
  * The [generated style for rasters](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-7759) was fixed

 	
  * LayerGroups were [appearing more than once](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-6154) in GetCapabilities document

 	
  * [Stye Editor editors shown when submit button pressed](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-7828)

 	
  * [KML timestamp date / month swapped](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-5879)

 	
  * Work on the Windows installer, you can now set up the jetty service to [use port 80](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-7827)

 	
  * Vector Tiles [graduated from community](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/wiki/GSIP-138) to an official extension

 	
  * Moving all "Bug Stomp" organization to the issue tracker (previously we were using a spreadsheet to short list items that were ready to be worked on).


The community modules also got some love:

 	
  * OAuth2 community module now [supports geonode](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-7818) and can work with [multiple OAuth2 providers](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-7824)


We understand that it can be very difficult to balance customers deadlines and open source responsibilities. We would like to thank [GeoSolutions](http://geosolutions.it), [Boundless](http://boundlessgeo.com) and [Transient](http://transient.nz) for their monthly commitment. If your organization is interested in taking part, and being recognized in these blog posts, contact a PSC member for details.
