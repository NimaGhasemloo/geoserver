Just wanted to give a shout out to a great event for those in Africa or interested in the application of geospatial technologies in Africa.  [WhereCampAfrica](http://www.wherecampafrica.org/) is an unconference, in the style of [BarCamp](http://barcamp.org) and [WhereCamp](http://wherecamp.pbwiki.com/), where anyone can show up and present and discuss the (spatial) ideas that excite them.  It should be a great group of people, it runs right after the [CGIAR-CSI](http://csi.cgiar.org/index.asp) meeting which I had a good time at least year.  Anyone using GeoServer who can make it out there should definitely attend.  It's a totally free event.
