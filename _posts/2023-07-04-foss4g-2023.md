The GeoServer team was pleased to attend [FOSS4G 2023](https://2023.foss4g.org/) last week (26 June - 2 July 2023) in Prizren, Kosovo!

FOSS4G 2023 was put on this year by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation ([OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/)) and the regional Free Libre Open Source Software Kosova ([FLOSSK](https://flossk.org)) organization. The [local organizing committee](https://2023.foss4g.org/about/team/) worked very hard to make everyone feel welcome and well cared for. Thank you for hosting everyone, we had a great time.

## FOSS4G Code sprint

We also had our first scheduled codesprint on [refactoring org.opengis](https://www.osgeo.org/opengis-harmonization/) package. The foss4g sprint was a fact-finding mission to establish the scope of work and confirm time frame and budget. 

* The activity was successful in that we were able to change from *org.opengis* to *org.geotools.api* and write a script to update GeoWebCache and GeoServer projects.
* GeoServer has some difficulties as *gs-printing* and *gs-geofence-server* include the work of external projects which will require assistance.

The work is scheduled for the [Bolsena Codesprint 2023](https://www.osgeo.org/events/bolsena-code-sprint-2023/) ahead of the GeoServer 2.24.0 release cycle.
