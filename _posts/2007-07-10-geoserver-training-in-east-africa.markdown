Mick Wilson, who I had the pleasure of meeting while I was doing a fellowship in Zambia, has been doing some [great blogging](http://sdi-ea.blogspot.com/) lately about the progress in building a Spatial Data Infrastructure in East Africa.  His [latest entry](http://sdi-ea.blogspot.com/2007/07/sdi-ea-first-handzon-training-changes.html) talks about a hands on training they ran, setting up GeoServer with PostGIS, uDig and qGIS.  It sounds like it was quite successful, and it's really great to see GeoServer being used to help build capacity and give people the ability to share data.  We're hoping to get feedback from his group and others on how to run such a training day, as it sounds like a great way to share skills and spread knowledge about GeoServer and the SDI stack around it.  If you're interested in running your own training day or have done so in the past, please get in touch.
