Mike Frumin, who has been actively working with GeoServer and OpenLayers the past few months, has just released the culmination of his work for the [Regional Planning Association](http://www.rpa.org/).  In his [write up](http://frumin.net/ation/2007/06/le_triboro_rx.html) on his blog he includes a number of pictures that were generated by GeoServer, and links to a really nice OpenLayers [application](http://transit.frumin.net/trx/trx.html), as well as the same information in Google Earth.  Both made extensive use of GeoServer, with some custom processing for a couple things that were pushing the envelope (that we hope to completely support in GeoServer eventually), including KML customization and SLD extensions.  Read his post, it's a great demonstration of using maps to tell a story, and we're excited that they're powered by GeoServer.
