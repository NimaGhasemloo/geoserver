The GeoServer team is happy to announce the launching of a new website atÂ [http://geoserver.org](http://geoserver.org).

Over the past few weeks you may have noticed issues with the site being down or unresponsive. It has moved from a self hosted Confluence instance to a GitHub powered site that will be much more reliable moving forward.

During this transition we have also taken the opportunity to do some site redesign. We hope you like the new look and feel.

Regards,

The GeoServer Team
