The GeoServer team is proud to announce the second release candidate for the 1.5 series. This release brings us closer to the stable 1.5.0 release of GeoServer that contains the new and exciting coverage support (WCS). To compliment the release we have created more documentation and [tutorials](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOSDOC/Load+NASA+Blue+Marble+Data), along with some [tools](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/geoserver/CoverageTools-0.2.exe?use_mirror=easynews) to help you process your raster images.

You can download the latest version [here](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOS/GeoServer+1.5.0-RC2).

Changes in this version include:
- Bug fixes
- Kml returns proper PNG files
- Kml strips out illegal characters now
- Improved error messages
- UI improvements
- Inline features are back
- Links to old homepage updated
- Performance optimization
