Community member Michelle Ballinger has put together a short tutorial on [creating an open source web map](  http://mballingercapstone.web.officelive.com/default.aspx) using GeoServer.

This tutorial is designed for a beginner and is easy to follow.  The steps she uses are:





  1. Creating and editing data with QGIS


  2. Designing SLDs with uDig


  3. Serving maps with GeoServer


  4. Creating a custom OpenLayers application


  5. Posting to the web



The introduction mentions the benefits of using open source and also, interestingly, discusses the pros and cons of making a "mash-up" versus serving one's own data.

Once again, we see Penn State as a proponent of open source GIS.  Have you looked at their [Master of Geographic Information Systems](https://gis.e-education.psu.edu/mgis) program lately?
