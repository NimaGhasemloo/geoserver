Though he's already snuck in a [blog post](http://blog.geoserver.org/2008/03/04/geoserver-161-released/), I want to give a warm welcome to Mike Pumphrey, the new 'outreach engineer' at TOPP, who we're going to see a lot more of on this blog.   His role is still being defined, but he's basically here as a resource to the community, to help out with documentation, to welcome new users, to manage releases, to create compelling demos, to make announcements, and much, much more.  In time he'll also be leading up commercial quality web and telephone support around GeoServer, and creating mapping applications for clients.  But he'll always be available to help out on [irc](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOSDOC/3+IRC) (where he is known as bmmpxf) and on the email lists, so help him out as he gets up to speed, and soon he'll be helping you out.
