title: GeoServer developers considering a switch to Java 6
wordpress_id: 984
---

GeoServer developers are considering a switch to Java 6 as the minimum requirement starting with GeoServer 2.2.0: this will give us an improved API to rely on, faster development cycle and a more common development environment setup (finding Java 5 is getting increasingly difficult, especially on some platforms).

The current stable series, 2.1.x, will remain on Java 5, giving people stuck on the old JDK at the very least another six months of support.

We'd like to hear your opinion on this move. Let us know by voting on the user poll:
