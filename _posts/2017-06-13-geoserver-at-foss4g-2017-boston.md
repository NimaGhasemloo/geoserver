The annual "Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial" conference is coming to Boston on August 14-19.

This is the global meeting-of-the-tribes event for the spatial community, held by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. Going well beyond just an event, FOSS4G features hands-on workshops, exciting presentation, technical presentations, exciting technical presentations ... along with informal bird-of-a-feather gatherings, a code sprint, and social events.

The GeoServer project is proudly represented at FOSS4G with presentations from the core GeoServer team and success stories from happy users worldwide.

  * **Mapping the world: going beyond web mercator with GeoServer: **Andrea provides insight into the creativity available with GeoServer.

 	
  * **State of GeoWebCache:** Kevin Smith explores tile protocols and the advantages they bring to your GeoServer deployment.

Bring your questions, your stories and perhaps a map to share!

An OSGeo code-sprint is held after the conference offering volunteers a chance to work on the codebase. If you are new to our community please consider attending, we will have a selection of activities ready to go for all skill levels.

Sign up on the [OSGeo Wiki](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_2017_Code_Sprint#GeoServer), and add your ideas and suggestions.

This is a great opportunity to contribute to the project, please be advised that it is a work party (so bring your own laptop, caffeine will be provided).
