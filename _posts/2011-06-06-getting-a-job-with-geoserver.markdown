As GeoServer popularity raises it's becoming more and more common to see job offers demanding GeoServer experience as a requisite. The companies providing support for GeoServer are growing as well, providing opportunities to the brave souls that want to work side by side with the core developers.

[GeoSolutions](http://www.geo-solutions.it/), an italian company deeply involved in both GeoServer and GeoTools, is looking for a [GeoServer developer](http://geo-solutions.blogspot.com/2011/06/job-offer-geosolutions_02.html) that will code new features as well as install and manage production sites. GeoSolutions is also looking for a [front-end developer](http://geo-solutions.blogspot.com/2011/02/job-offer-geosolutions.html) that will develop the user facing portion of new geo-spatial applications powered by GeoServer.
