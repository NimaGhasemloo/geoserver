The GeoServer web administration console is built on top of the [Wicket](https://wicket.apache.org/) 1.4.x series, which is pretty old and unmaintaned. The purpose of the sprint is to update it to Wicket 7.x, the current stable version.

Due to the large distance between the two releases and the number of backwards incompatible changes accumulated by Wicket in the years this will require the concerted effort of a handful of developers over a few days, including the changes to upgrade the code, and the thorough hand testing of the resulting modified interface.





## Victoria British Columbia




The code sprint is planned for the week of **January 18th **in sunny **Victoria British Columbia**. Thanks to Boundless for providing a venue (either the boundless offices or [Fort Techtoria](http://forttectoria.ca) depending on numbers).




A note on the timing: We were unable to join the [Paris Code Sprint 2016](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Paris_Code_Sprint_2016) as it is scheduled too close to the GeoServer 2.9 code freeze. This location was selected to reduce travel costs allowing us to run the event with minimal sponsorship.





## Participation and Sponsorship


We have the following sponsorship levels available:



	
  * Gold: $1000

	
  * Silver: $500

	
  * Bronze: $250


We are reaching out to international and local sponsors. Contributions will be put towards travel costs for overseas sprinters who would be otherwise unable to attend. Any surplus at the end of the event will be turned over to OSGeo or used for a future code sprints.

For more details on participation, sponsorship or budget for the event please see the [GeoServer Code Sprint 2016](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GeoServer_Code_Sprint_2016) wiki page.
