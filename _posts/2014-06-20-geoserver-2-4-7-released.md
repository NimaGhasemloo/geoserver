  * Rendering and referencing improvements for both polar projections and whole earth projections.

	
  * Rendering fixes for multi-line labels

	
  * UI fix for keeping SLD files separated during editing

	
  * Security fixes for those using CAS security

	
  * Using WPS and workspaces? This release has a few fixes for you.

Now is a great time to upgrade to GeoServer 2.5. If you need more time there is a final 2.4 maintenance release scheduled for August (as part of our [extended release schedule](http://blog.geoserver.org/2014/02/26/extended-release-schedule/).)
