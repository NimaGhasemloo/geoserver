The GeoServer team is happy to announce the second beta release of GeoServer 2.2, now available for [download](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/GeoServer+2.2-beta2).

The 2.2-beta2 release includes a number of great improvements and bug fixes. Some of the highlights include:



	
  * Support for **8-bit PNG output with transparency** resulting in a nice tradeoff of performance and appealing visualization. Special thanks to Andrea for this new feature.

	
  * Continued work for supporting **high accuracy datum transformations** that now allows for user defined transformations supplied via WKT. Thanks to the [Catalan Cartographic Institute](http://www.icc.cat) for funding the work and to Oscar Fonts and Andrea for doing the development.

	
  * A new** lenient capabilities mode** that allows the GeoServer capabilities documents to remain functioning despite the presence of misconfigured layers. Thanks to David Winslow for this work.


And much more. See the complete [changelog](http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS/fixforversion/18437) of this release for the entire list.

[Download](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/GeoServer+2.2-beta2) and try out 2.2-beta2 today. You can help us get closer to the official 2.2 release by reporting issues in the [bug tracker](http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS) and on the [mailing list](mailto:geoserver-users@lists.sourceforge.net).

Thanks for supporting GeoServer!
