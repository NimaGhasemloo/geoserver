The GeoServer team is pleased to announce the release of [GeoServer 2.8.5](http://geoserver.org/release/2.8.5/). Download bundles are provided ([bin](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.8.5/geoserver-2.8.5-bin.zip/download), [war](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.8.5/geoserver-2.8.5-war.zip/download), [dmg](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.8.5/geoserver-2.8.5.dmg/download) and [exe](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.8.5/geoserver-2.8.5.exe/download)) along with documentation and extensions.

GeoServer 2.8.5 is the final maintenance release of the 2.8.x series. This release is made by Ben Caradoc-Davies ([Transient](http://transient.nz/)) in conjunction with [GeoTools 14.5](http://geotoolsnews.blogspot.com/2016/08/geotools-145-released.html) and GeoWebCache 1.8.3. We thank the many contributors who have made this release possible.

The [GeoServer 2.8.5 release notes](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10000&version=13200) detail the changes in this release. These include:



 	
  * Fixes for WFS editing failing for geometries in full 3D CRS

 	
  * ColorMap variable substitution now working correctly for multiple layers in a GetMap request

 	
  * Fixed a missing JNA jar in the netcdf-out plugin

 	
  * KML placemarks now being set correctly when KMSCORE=0

 	
  * Support for multivalued xlink:href ClientProperty in app-schema mappings, even without feature chaining

 	
  * Support requiring files to exist for GeoServer startup, to protect against insecure fallback when a data directory on a network share is unavailable










### Security Considerations


This release includes several security enhancements and is a recommended upgrade for production systems:



 	
  * Although we have not been able to reproduce from GeoServer, a remote execution vulnerability has been reported against both the Restlet  and the Apache Commons BeanUtils libraries we use. We have patched our use of these libraries as a preventative measure. We would like to thank Kevin Smith for doing the bulk of the work, and Andrea Aime for providing a patched BeanUtils library addressing these vulnerabilities.

 	
  * Layer security restrictions in CHALLENGE mode were not being correctly applied by embedded GeoWebCache. Thanks to Nick Muerdter for his responsible report of this vulnerability and for submitting a fix (that included a unit test!)

 	
  * Carl Schroedl reported a vulnerability at application startup when working with a data directory on a network file system, a new [configuration option](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/datadirectory/setting.html#require-files-to-exist) has been provided to check that the directory exists.  Thanks to Carl for following our responsible disclosure procedure, and to Ben Caradoc-Davies for implementing the new parameter.
