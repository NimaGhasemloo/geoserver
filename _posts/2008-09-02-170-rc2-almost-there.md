We've received some good feedback from the community on the first release candidate of version 1.7.0, and have made some improvements that we wanted to share with you.  This [second release candidate](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/GeoServer+1.7.0-RC2) is more stable and features some code-tightening as well (MIME types are now case insensitive, a limited SRS list persists again, [and more](http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS/fixforversion/14500).)  This is the most stable release yet of the new 1.7.0 branch and we encourage you to [try it out](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/GeoServer+1.7.0-RC2).  If all goes according to plan, we should have a final release around the corner.
