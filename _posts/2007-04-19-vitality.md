With all the releases that the GeoServer team has been making, topped off by [1.5.0](http://blog.geoserver.org/2007/04/18/geoserver-150-released/), we've managed to crack the top 20 open source projects on [freshmeat.net](http://freshmeat.net) for 'vitality'.  We've got a lot more coming out soon, so hopefully we'll be up there and even higher in the future.  If you're reading this today, you can go to [http://freshmeat.net/stats/#vitality](http://freshmeat.net/stats/#vitality) and see.  If not we've got the screenshot.
