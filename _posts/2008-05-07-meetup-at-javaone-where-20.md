Chris Holmes and I are at JavaOne in San Francisco this week, and Chris and Justin will also be going to Where 2.0. We are wondering whether there are any GeoServer users here, or in the bay area in general, that would be interested in meeting for lunch?

Tentatively around noon tomorrow, Thursday the 8th, near the Moscone center. Just an informal chat and a great opportunity to meet other users. Please email ak+meetup@openplans.org if you're interested and I'll be in touch with the details.

Also email me if you're going to Where 2.0, we'll try do something similar there as well.
