When the GeoServer Team [announced GeoServer 1.7.3 last Wednesday](http://blog.geoserver.org/2009/03/11/geoserver-173-released/), the response was quite impressive.  GeoServer received the largest [amount of downloads](https://sourceforge.net/project/stats/?group_id=25086&ugn=geoserver&type=&mode=30day) in a single day on Thursday, March 12th, at over 1,500 (normally the number is less than half that).  [Our website](http://geoserver.org) hit a new record of visits as well.

While we're all delighted, I wonder whether it was a new feature, a bug fix, or just new people coming on board that led to the spike.  As always, I'd like to know what we're doing well and what we could be doing better.
