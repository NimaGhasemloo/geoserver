Just recently [Justin Lokitz](http://www.orablogs.com/oragis/) of Leica published a new article on Oracle's Technology Network entitled '[Integrating Oracle Spatial with Google Earth](http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/lokitz-spatial-geoserver.html)'.  We were quite pleased to find that instead of telling people how to hand code some scripts for one-off KML his article instead highlighted the capabilities of GeoServer, demonstrating how it can be leveraged to easily connect Oracle Spatial to Google Earth.  He additionally follows up with a [post](http://www.orablogs.com/oragis/archives/001977.html) on his blog, containing a few corrections and updates on our latest improvements.  Users of Oracle Spatial will certainly find his information quite helpful.  And it's great to see articles on GeoServer coming from all sorts of different perspectives, aimed at different audiences.  If you've got an urge to write about GeoServer let us know and we're more than happy to promote it and to find venues to publish in.
