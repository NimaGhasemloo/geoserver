Just a quick shout: The .war for GeoWebCache 0.7.0 was accidentally compiled using a mixture of Java versions and was therefore quietly replaced with 0.7.1 the same morning. Since then Andrea and Jason have been busy reporting bugs, most of which have been closed. Updates include the return of JAI, support for vendor specific parameters in the configuration files, and image/png8 support. So without further ado, [GeoWebCache 0.7.2](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=215120).
