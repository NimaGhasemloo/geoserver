On the GeoServer developer list we've been discussing reducing browser  support in the GeoServer web administration console - browser-based  clients using OpenLayers and other JavaScript mapping libraries would be  unaffected but the admin console would have support for fewer  browsers.Â  Please help inform this decision by letting us know which  browsers you are using to configure GeoServer at this web form:

We'll review the results in one week. Thanks!
