Quoting from the [geoSDI](http://geosdi.nsdi.it/index.php?lang=english) web site,

"geoSDI is the complete solution for Spatial Data Infrastructure used by the **Italian National Civil Protection Department**.

The geoSDI solution is based on Open Source Technologies and was born to allow the real time geospatial data sharing between the Functional Centers of the Italian Civil Protection Department, being **OGC** (Open Geospatial Consortium) standard compliant, **INSPIRE** Directive compliant and **CNIPA** _Repertorio Nazionali dei Dati Territoriali_ specifications compliant."

The  geoSDI infrastructure aims to provide a coherent National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) which is compliant with national and internal recognized standard as outlined by organizations like ISO and OGC as well as by initiatives like INSPIRE.

We are glad to announce that a core role in the geoSID inititive will be played by the GeoServer framework and that [**GeoSolutions SAS**](http://www.geo-solutions.it) has been selected to provide professional support for the developments and customizations required.  Stay tuned for more information on the topic.
