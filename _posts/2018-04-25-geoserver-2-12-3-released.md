## Improvements





 	
  * Improved bounding box reporting in WMS GetCapabilities allowing more entries to be supported when _Output bounding box for every support CRS_ is selected. Bounding boxes are now returned for layer groups as well.

 	
  * NetCDF/GRIB has been improved with a [new setting](http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/extensions/netcdf-out/index.html#settings) to copy over global attributes when generating NetCDF output




## Bug Fixes





 	
  * WFS 2.0 fix for interaction with startIndex and the total features count

 	
  * CQL filters can now be used with the WMS vector tile output format

 	
  * GeoPackage WPS output corrected to generate y coordinates from bottom left

 	
  * User interface for editing workspace details checks for conflicts with name or namespace URI.

 	
  * GML 3.2 output can now limit the number of decimals used for coordinate output

 	
  * REST management of styles now supports defining a style using POST for CSS, YSLD and MapBox styles (previously this only worked for SLD)

 	
  * WPS output error handling does a better job reporting when Async output format parameters are incorrect.

 	
  * WPS improvements have also been made for the cleanup of temporary folders and output "raw data encoder" (which is often used for image generation).

 	
  * Demo request page does a better job of of reporting authorization failures, and correctly sending credentials for testing service security.

 	
  * GetLegendGraphic fixes to correct line thickness and ensure polygons and points are not cut off.




## Community Updates


For developers building from source our community modules remain a great place to collaborate on new functionality and improvements. This month Nuno Oliveira has added a new community module for the GeoTools MongoDB datastore.


## Security Updates


Please update your production instances of GeoServer to receive the latest security updates and fixes.

If you encounter a security vulnerability in GeoServer, or any other open source software, please take care to report the issue in a [responsible fashion](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/introduction/gettinginvolved.html#bug-tracking).
