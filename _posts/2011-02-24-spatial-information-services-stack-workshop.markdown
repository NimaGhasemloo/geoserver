22-24 March 2011
Geoscience Australia
Cnr Jerrabomberra Ave and Hindmarsh Drive
Symonston ACT 2609

**Background **

The Spatial Information Services Stack (SISS) is a suite of tools for spatial data interoperability. SISS uses OGC standards, GML application schema, modelling tools, vocabulary support services and registries. AuScope is deploying the SISS in multiple Australian Government agencies and research organisations. AuScope has developed a Web portal to demonstrate the infrastructure, and to encourage the development of other third party client tools. As SISS is built on open source technologies others are encouraged to use the stack and assist in its development.

SISS builds on existing technologies including GeoServer, FullMoon and GeoNetwork. AuScope has made enhancements to support complex application schemas like GeoSciML and WaterML, and quality improvements to raise the quality of service level and ensure stack completeness. For example, the AuScope portal uses GeoNetwork to discover services, and the application schemas supported by GeoServer are developed and tested with FullMoon. SISS provides a complete solution to develop, establish and maintain OGC standards compliant infrastructures.The development of SISS was funded by NCRIS through the NeAT initiative.

**Workshop goal **

The goal of the workshop is to show how communities can use SISS to provide transparent interoperable access to spatial data and knowledge about Australia.

Space is limited so places will be allocated to ensure representation from the greatest number of organisations in each session.
