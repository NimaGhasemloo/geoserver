Congratulations to the [GeoServer community in Brazil](http://br.geoserver.org/) for [five years of activity](http://www.fernandoquadro.com.br/html/2012/05/13/5-anos-de-geoserver-br/)! Since the first training conducted at ENUM III, the Lusophone community has grown to more than 500 mailing list subscribers and 3200 email threads from across several Portuguese-speaking countries.  Most notable among their many achievements, however, is the establishment of GeoServer as the official map server of [INDE](http://www.inde.gov.br/), the Brazilian national spatial data infrastructure (SDI), in 2008 by then-President Lula. Parabéns!
