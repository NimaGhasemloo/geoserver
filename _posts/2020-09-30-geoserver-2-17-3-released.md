### Improvements and Fixes

This release includes a number of improvements. Notable improvements:


  * SLDService can now advertise supported classification methods (for future proofing clients, in case new methods are added later down the road). A new standard deviation based classification method has been added.
  * App-schema generating simple feature outputs (pure mapping) can now be used with all the common simple feature formats too, like shapefile, CSV, KML and so on.
  * It's possible to disable auto-complete of the UI login
  * Importer has been optimized to avoid full directory scans while importing single files. This coupled with similar optimizations in image mosaic harvesting, speeds up significantly harvesting new files via importer, when contained in directories having many files.
  * The vector tiles output can now get full benefit from a pre-generalized data source, reading the features at the resolution required to generate the vector tiles (was previously using the highest resolution available).
  * The Jiffle process/rendering transformation can now generate multi-band outputs, and its performance received a few improvements.

Fixes included in this release:

  * Memory management of raster GDAL sources has been improved.
  * Layer preview with strict WMS compliance was not working any longer, this has been fixed.

### Community Updates

For developers building from source, our community modules are a great place to collaborate on functionality and improvements.


  * The wfs-templating module has received a few improvements, and has been renamed to features-templating, to clarify it can be used with OGC API - Feautures, as well as WFS.
