Just a quick note, which I'm putting in the 'Tips and Tricks' category, since it's a trick to get quick feedback from the GeoServer community.  For many years the core GeoServer developers were not good at maintaining a consistent presence on IRC, which is used heavily in many open source projects.  We'd run meetings there, of course, but would not usually be on unless there was a specific meeting.t

In the past few months we've been getting a lot better, and are starting to get a group of people who are generally present on IRC.  For more details on how to get on IRC see the [IRC section](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOSDOC/3+IRC) of our docs.  It also has information on the weekly meeting, which everyone is welcome to take part in.  So please, come join us and let us know what you're doing and wanting to do with GeoServer.
