The [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc) is upon us!  (Yes, it does seem like we just finished SoC 2008.)  GeoServer is once again a part of this process and we have a [list of projects](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Summer+of+Code+2009) posted for anyone who is interested.

We are assuming all students interested in working on GeoServer will have solid Java knowledge, but no geospatial or GIS knowledge is required (although it will not hurt).

We've got lots of good ideas posted, from [styling maps with CSS](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Styling+maps+with+CSS) to [integration with NASA WorldWind](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/WorldWind+Integration) and [more](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Summer+of+Code+2009).  The deadline for applications is **April 3rd**, so if you are interested in contributing, please see the [OSGeo page on Summer of Code](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code), or feel free to email the [GeoServer developers list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/geoserver-devel).
