We seem to be releasing something every week now, a testament to our tireless developers and input of the community.  Last week, we released [1.6.5](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/GeoServer+1.6.5), which is still the official stable release at the time of writing.  However, we are closer than ever to a stable release of the 1.7.0 branch, and today we release the [third release candidate of 1.7.0](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/GeoServer+1.7.0-RC3) to the wider world.  Among others, there were two pernicious bugs that caused FeatureTypes and coverages to disappear in certain circumstances.  (Yikes!)  No more, though.  In total, there are [19 bug fixes](http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS/fixforversion/14538) in since RC2, and as usual, we encourage you to [test out the latest version](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/GeoServer+1.7.0-RC3).  Will the fourth release candidate be the charm?  Stay tuned.
