[The Open Planning Project](http://topp.openplans.org/) (TOPP), the main sponsor of GeoServer development, is pleased to announce the recent hiring of Andreas Hocevar, one of the [top five committers](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/3667/contributors) of [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org), the default front end mapping engine for GeoServer.  Andreas has been doing a lot of work in OpenLayers on SLD, the open standard to style maps, which is what GeoServer uses to define styles.  His initial work will be focused on intuitive creation of SLDs for GeoServer, utilizing OpenLayers and the [Ext.js](http://extjs.com/) gui framework.  This will be one of the main pieces of the plan to let [everyone remix maps](http://cholmes.wordpress.com/2008/03/05/letting-everyone-remix-web-maps/).  Afterwards he will continue to work on applications built on both frameworks and open standards.  We are excited to have Andreas aboard to help TOPP continue to expand its offerings to a full open geospatial stack, and to strengthen the relationship between GeoServer and OpenLayers.
