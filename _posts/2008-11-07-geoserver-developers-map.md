GeoServer is a open source project, developed and supported by a diverse group of people from around the world. To highlight this, [OpenGeo](http://opengeo.org) has built a simple [map](http://demo.opengeo.org/developers-map/) showing the locations of GeoServer developers. Each developer's location is marked with a blue point.  Clicking on that point will produce a pop-up with the developer's name and a brief bio.







[GeoServer Developers Map](http://demo.opengeo.org/developers-map/)







This map interface is built using [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org).  The data points are saved in a [PostGIS](http://postgis.refractions.net/) database and are served through GeoServer.  OpenLayers accesses the data using the [WFS protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service).  The background image is currently the Google terrain layer, but will soon be replaced by [ OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org) data.







If you are a GeoServer developer and wish to be included on the map, [let us know](mailto:inquiry@opengeo.org).  Please include your name, a short bio, and the city, state, and country where you live.   If anyone has any other comments about this map or the technology behind it, please write to us at [inquiry@opengeo.org.](mailto:inquiry@opengeo.org)
