We are happy to announce GeoServer [2.20.6](/release/2.20.6/) release is available with downloads ([bin](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.20.6/geoserver-2.20.6-bin.zip/download), [war](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.20.6/geoserver-2.20.6-war.zip/download), [windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.20.6/GeoServer-2.20.6-winsetup.exe/download)), along with [docs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.20.6/geoserver-2.20.6-htmldoc.zip/download) and [extensions](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.20.6/extensions/).

This is the last planned maintenance release for the 2.20.x series, please consider upgrading to the 2.21.x series. 
This release was made in conjunction with GeoTools 26.6 and GeoWebCache 1.20.4.

### Improvements and Fixes

* It's now possible to use the REST API to reset caches for a single store or a single layer.
* GeoFence role filtering was improved.
* OSHI was updated to allow gathering OS statistics on Apple M2 as well.
* Assorted small improvements to the status page.
* An infinite recursion in GWC transparent integration with WMS was spotted and fixed (affected vector tiles and layers with a meta-tiling factor of 1, when the "TILED" parameter was turned off).
* The GWC module was split so that its REST API can be excluded (for completely headless installs).

For the full list of fixes and improvements, see [2.20.6 release notes](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/releases/tag/2.20.6).
