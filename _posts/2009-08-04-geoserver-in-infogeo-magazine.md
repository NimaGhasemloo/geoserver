GeoServer is featured in an [article in InfoGEO magazine](http://www.mundogeo.com.br/revistas-interna.php?id_noticia=14180).  Written by active community member Fernando Quadro, the article is a brief overview of GeoServer.  There may not be anything new here for those who are already familiar with GeoServer, but it's still great to see GeoServer in print.

This is a good time to remind everyone that GeoServer has mailing lists in [Portuguese](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/geoserver/), along with [Italian](http://groups.google.com/group/geoserver-ita) and [Spanish](http://groups.google.com/group/geoserver-es).  Moreover, with the switch to our [new documentation system](http://docs.geoserver.org/), we now have the ability to have GeoServer documentation in multiple languages.
