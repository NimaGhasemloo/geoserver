Just wanted to get a quick note in the blog, that Google [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/) is now open for student applications.  GeoServer is participating as part of [OSGeo](http://osgeo.org)'s [project](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2008_Ideas).  We participated last year as well, and had a great success with Chris Whitney's [JTileCache](http://code.google.com/p/jtilecache/) project, which has since evolved in to [GeoWebcache](http://geowebcache.org).  There is the opportunity to improve GeoWebcache this year, as well as potential projects on SQL Server, some Amazon Web Services related ones, spatial index for H2 and more.  See the [ideas page](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Summer+of+Code+2008), and if you're a student (or mentor) with another idea please don't hesitate to propose it.  The developers can help flesh out ideas on the lists and on IRC.Â  Oh, and the deadline for students to apply is March 31st, next Monday, so get working on your applications as soon as possible, as the process moves quickly.
