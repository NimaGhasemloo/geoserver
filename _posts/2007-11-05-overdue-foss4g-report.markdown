So it's been way too long since we posted anything on this blog other than release announcements.  Which is not as it should be, since there's been a ton happening in the GeoServer community.  I'm going to try to catch up with a lot of the various news in the next week or two, but wanted to just mention things here, which should force us to actually blog about them in more depth soon.

The first big category is the [FOSS4G](http://www.foss4g2007.org/) conference.  The conference team did an amazing job, so first just want to thank them for all their hard work.  From the GeoServer perspective it was easily our best conference yet, with a number of talks from developers and users.  In coming posts I'll highlight the talks more, with links to check them all out.  The conference is definitely the highlight of the year for those of us working on the project, because we get to meet so many excited users.  Both those that we've seen on the lists before, and people who have just been happily making use of GeoServer and had no reason to get in touch with us.  We also get invaluable feedback on the features users actually care about.

After the conference we had a successful 'code sprint' - most projects sprinted on Friday, but the hard-core GeoTools team followed up working through the weekend.  Thanks goes out to [Refractions](http://www.refractions.net) for hosting us, giving us space to work away.  We worked on the biggest elephant in subversion - the new feature model that allows us to deal with complex types.  Its had many years of effort, many failed branches, and just became a scary task that seemed like it might never be done.  But Justin worked for months preparing for the sprint, where we moved almost everything to use the new way.  Initially uDig will see the results of the work first, but it was some nice implications for GeoServer - serving up set schemas from arbitrary data - when someone comes up with a bit of additional funding/time.

In other news we've been getting some great contributions of late, which I'll write about soon.  [The Open Planning Project](http://topp.openplans.org), the primary maintainer of GeoServer, is also working on some exciting stuff, including mapping integration with the other main project - [OpenPlans](http://www.openplans.org).  The end result should be a really nice user interface for groups to make annotated maps, with full wiki-like editing, about the issues they care about.
