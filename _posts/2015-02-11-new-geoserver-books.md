The GeoServer website has featured [GeoServer Beginner's Guide](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/geoserver-beginner%E2%80%99s-guide) by Stefano Iacovella and Brian Youngblood for a couple of years now. In addition to being an [excellent resource](http://www.lisasoft.com/blog/geoserver-beginners-guide), a portion of each sale goes back to the Open Source Geospatial Foundation.

The publisher, Packt, has extended a 50% off three-pack deal (to introduce two new GeoServer books):
