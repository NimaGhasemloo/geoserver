[We](http://www.geo-solutions.it) have been using JBoss extensively in the last two years in order deploy GeoServer along with some custom extensions as well as a few other proprietary application. Lately we have started to experiment a bit with JBoss 5.x and since people seem to have problems deplying GeoServer in it weput together a post on our compay blog (see [here](http://geo-solutions.blogspot.com/2009/07/deploying-geoserver-on-jboss-as-5x.html)) with some basic instructions on how to deploy GeoServer 1.7.6 inside JBoss 5.1.

If you you need help wrestling with JBoss, feel free to contact us!
