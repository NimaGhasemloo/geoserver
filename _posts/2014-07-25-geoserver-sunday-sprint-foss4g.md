Back in March we had a **[Save the Date](http://blog.geoserver.org/2014/03/05/foss4g-2014-save-the-date/)** post for FOSS4G 2014 in Portland. Check your travel plans include participating in the [Code Sprint](https://2014.foss4g.org/schedule/code-sprint/) at the end of the conference.

The code sprint is an opportunity for the team to get together and work on "tough problems without funding". For GeoServer we have two candidates:



	
  1. Update to a recent version of Wicket to improve browser compatibility

	
  2. Update CITE Conformance Tests


GeoServer is extending the code sprint to include:

	
  * Saturday, September 13th: FOSS4G is providing facilities at [WhereCampPDX](http://wherecamppdx.org/).

	
  * Sunday, September 14th: Boundless is arranging facilities at [nedspace](http://nedspace.com/) from 10am-4pm.


To attend add your name to OSGeo [wiki](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_2014_Code_Sprint) page and we will look forward to seeing you in Portland!
