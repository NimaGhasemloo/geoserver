For the past few months, the GeoServer team has been working  behind the scenes on rebranding GeoServer.  Historically, GeoServer hasn't had a very strong visual identity, but there has been significant interest as of late, especially as talk of [the new GeoServer UI has entered alpha status](http://blog.geoserver.org/2008/08/11/a-new-ui-is-dawning/).  So, ace stylers Andy Cochran and Chris Patterson worked their design magic and came up with a [new icon, logo, and color scheme](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/New+GeoServer+Branding).  So now we officially unveil the new look of [geoserver.org](http://geoserver.org) (and this blog)!  This was an iterative process, and the materials benefited from community involvement (specifically the icon, which now happily manages to squeeze in all continents).  Elements of this design will eventually be incorporated into GeoServer itself.  We also have a website which contains [icons and logos available for download](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/New+GeoServer+Branding).  We hope you like the new look as much as we do.

If you're reading this blog through an RSS feed, why don't you [check out the site itself](http://blog.geoserver.org)?
