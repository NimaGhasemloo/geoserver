I'd like to quickly congratulate the uDig developers team for releasing the newest version of uDig.  [uDig 1.1](http://udig.refractions.net) has a venerable history.  [Quite a venerable history](http://lists.refractions.net/pipermail/udig-devel/2006-June/005193.html), as releases go.  In fact, I think uDig might be in line for some kind of [Guinness](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/)-style award for having the most release candidates (with 14 RCs and even 3 Sanity Checks).  I certainly don't mean this as a dig (sorry, couldn't help myself); it just shows that the team wanted to be sure to release a quality product as free of bugs as possible.  That said, the GeoServer team does feel slightly better about our growing number of release candidates (currently at [1.7.0-RC4](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/GeoServer+1.7.0-RC4)).  No matter.  uDig is an excellent desktop GIS product and is a great complement to GeoServer.  (I personally have always appreciated its ability to generate SLDs quickly and painlessly.)  [Go check it out](http://udig.refractions.net/download/).

**Update: **I've been asked off-camera about uDig's editing capabilities.  uDig does in fact follow the [WFS-T(ransaction)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs) standard, and is one of the best clients out there for doing so.  In this way, one can use uDig to edit features served using GeoServer from the safety of a familiar GUI.  That's big news (shapefiles and other data structures can be rather opaque to edit otherwise) and I think it merits a mention here.
