This release includes plenty of bug fixes and new improvements such as:



	
  * Have rest endpoint display a note when no rest extensions are installed

	
  * Rearrange GWC UI components for higher consistency

	
  * Support EPSG:102113 as an alias for web mercator

	
  * Write GWC specific HTTP response headers when using direct WMS integration

	
  * Control the meta tile output format cache so that external apps can drop it on demand

	
  * Made it possible to configure embedded gwc tile layers through the REST API

	
  * Made GWC "direct WMS integration" work with virtual services
