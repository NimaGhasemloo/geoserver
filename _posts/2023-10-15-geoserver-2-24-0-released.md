## Upgrade Notes

GeoServer strives to maintain backwards compatibility allowing for a smooth upgrade experience.

We have one minor change to share in this release:

* URL Checks: The [url check security setting](https://docs.geoserver.org/maintain/en/user/security/urlchecks.html) is now enabled by default.
  
  In GeoServer 2.22.5 and 2.23.2 this setting was available for use, but was turned off by default.
  If you are not yet in a position to upgrade to 2.24.0 you may wish to enable the recommended setting.

## Security Considerations

This release addresses security vulnerabilities and is considered an essential upgrade for production systems.

* [CVE-2023-43795](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security/advisories/GHSA-5pr3-m5hm-9956) WPS Server Side Request Forgery
* [CVE-2023-41339](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security/advisories/GHSA-cqpc-x2c6-2gmf) Unsecured WMS dynamic styling sld=url parameter affords blind unauthenticated SSRF

See project [security policy](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for more information on how security vulnerabilities are managed.

## IAU authority support and EPSG assumption removal

The new gs-iau extension module provides support for planetary CRSs, sourced from the International Astronomical Union. This allows users to manage GIS data over the Moon, Mars, or even the Sun, with well known, officially supported codes.

In addition to that, many bug fixes occurred in the management of CRSs and their text representations (plain codes, URL, URIs) so that the EPSG authority is no longer assumed to be the only possibility, in a variety of places, such as, for example, GML output.
The code base has seen this assumption for twenty long years already, and while we made a good effort to eliminate the assumption, it could be still lurking in some places. Please test and let us know.

## GeoServer Printing Extension Updates

The printing extension has seen big changes - with a host of new functionality developed by GeoSolutions over the years. With this update the printing module can now be used out-of-the-box by [GeoNode](https://geonode.org/) and [MapStore](https://mapstore.geosolutionsgroup.com/mapstore) (no more customization required).

This update covers the release of MapFish Print 2.3.0 (and restores [website](https://mapfish.github.io/mapfish-print-v2/) user-guide).

GeoServer documentation has been updated with [configuration options](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/extensions/printing/configuration.html) covering the new functionality.

* [Max number of columns configuration for multi column legends](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/extensions/printing/configuration.html#legends-block)

Thanks to GeoSolutions for adding functionality to mapfish-print for the GeoNode project. Shout out to Tobia Di Pisa and Giovanni Allegra for integration testing.
Jody Garnett (GeoCat) was responsible for updating the mapfish print-lib for Java 11 and gathering up the functionality from different branches and forks. And integrating the updated configuration instructions with the GeoServer User Guide.

* [GEOS-11159](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11159) Update mapfish-print-lib 2.3.0

## New Security > URL Checks page

The previous 2.23 series added a new Check URL facility under the Security menu, but it was turned off by default, for backwards compatibility reasons. This functionality allows administrators to manage OGC Service use of external resources.

This has been included in GeoServer 2.22.x and 2.23.x series for backwards compatibility. 

**Backwards compatibility note::** This functionality is turned ON by default from GeoServer 2.24.0 onwards.

## Project Updates

### Updated Security Policy

This release follows a [revised security policy](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/wiki/GSIP-220).
Our existing "responsible disclosure policy" has been renamed, the practice is now called "coordinated vulnerability disclosure."
Last year we enabled GitHub private vulnerability reporting, we will now use these facilities to issue CVE numbers.

> **Coordinated vulnerability disclosure**
> 
> Disclosure policy:
> 
> 1. The reported vulnerability has been verified by working with the geoserver-security list
> 2. GitHub [security advisory](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security) is used to reserve a CVE number
> 3. A fix or documentation clarification is accepted and backported to both the "stable" and "maintenance" branches
> 4. A fix is included for the "stable" and "maintenance" downloads ([released as scheduled](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/wiki/Release-Schedule), or issued via emergency update)
> 6. The CVE vulnerability is published with mitigation and patch instructions
> 
> This represents a balance between transparency and participation that does not overwhelm participants. 
> Those seeking greater visibility are encouraged to volunteer with the geoserver-security list;
> or work with one of the [commercial support providers](https://geoserver.org/support/) who participate on behalf of their customers.

This change has already resulted in improved interaction with security researchers.

Thanks to Jody Garnett (GeoCat) for this proposal on behalf of GeoCat Live customers.

## Developer updates

### Internal refactor to remove "org.opengis" package usage

The GeoTools project moved away from using the ``org.opengis`` package after complaints from OGC GeoAPI working group representatives, using
the same package name. Interfaces have been moved to the ``org.geotool.api`` package, along with some general clean up.

While this does not affect GeoServer users directly, it's of consequence for those that have installations with custom, home grown plugins
that might have to be migrated as a consequence. For those, the GeoTools project offers a migration guide, along with a refactoring
script that might perform the migration for you, or else, get you close to a working point. GeoServer itself has been migrated
using these scripts, with minimal manual intervention.

For more details, and access to the migration script, please see the [GeoTools 30 upgrade guide](https://docs.geotools.org/stable/userguide/welcome/upgrade.html#geotools-30-x).

Thanks to Jody Garnett (GeoCat), Andrea Aime (GeoSolutions), and Ian Turton (ASTUN Technologies) for all the hard work on this activity.
We would also like to thank the Open Source Geospatial Foundation for setting up a [cross-project activity](https://www.osgeo.org/opengis-harmonization/) and financial support
to address this requested change.

* [GEOS-11070](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net//browse/GEOS-11070) Upgrading to GeoTools 30.x series, refactor to ``org.geotools.api`` interfaces

## Community modules updates 

While not strictly part of this release, it's interesting to know about some community module advances that can be found only in the
the 2.24.x series.

Two extensions are no longer actively supported and are now available as community modules:

* [GEOS-10960](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net//browse/GEOS-10960) Downgrade imagemap module to community
* [GEOS-10961](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net//browse/GEOS-10961) Downgrade xslt extension to community

The following community modules have been removed (due to lack of interest):

* [GEOS-10962](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net//browse/GEOS-10962) Remove wms-eo community module
* [GEOS-10963](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net//browse/GEOS-10963) Remove SAML community module
* [GEOS-10966](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net//browse/GEOS-10966) Remove importer-fgdb community module
* [GEOS-10967](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net//browse/GEOS-10967) Remove teradata community module
* [GEOS-10977](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net//browse/GEOS-10977) Remove wmts-styles community module
* [GEOS-10978](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net//browse/GEOS-10978) Remove nsg-wmts community module
* [GEOS-10984](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net//browse/GEOS-10984) Remove ows-simulate community module

### OGC API community modules continues to improve

The OGC API community module keeps improving. In particular, thanks to the [GeoNovum](https://www.geonovum.nl/) sponsorship, GeoSolutions made the OGC API Features module pass the OGC CITE compliance tests, for the "core" and "CRS by reference" conformance classes.
Along with this work, other significant changes occurred:

* Made the API version number appear in the service path, easing future upgrades
* Support for configurable links, required to get INSPIRE download service compliance. 

In addition to that, the new "search" experimental conformance class allows to POST complex searches against collections, as a JSON document,
in a way similar to the STAC API.

![Editable OGC API links](/img/posts/2.24/api_features_compliance.png) 

![Editable OGC API links](/img/posts/2.24/ogc_api_links.png) 

Those interested in this work are encouraged to contact Andrea Aime (GeoSolutions).

* [GEOS-10954](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net//browse/GEOS-10954) Split ogcapi community module package into single functionality packages

### DataDir Catalogue loader

For folks working with very large catalogues some improvement from [cloud native geoserver](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver-cloud) are now available to reduce startup time.

Thanks to Gabriel Roldan for folding this improvement into a community module for the rest of the GeoServer community to enjoy.

* [GEOS-11049](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net//browse/GEOS-11049) Community module "datadir catalog loader"

### GeoServer Access Control List Project

The [GeoServer Access Control List](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver-acl) project is an independent application service that manages access rules, and a GeoServer plugin that requests authorization limits on a per-request basis.

Gabriel Roldan is the contact point for anyone interested in this work.

### The vector mosaic and FlatGeoBuf modules sport significant performance improvements

[FlatGeoBuf](https://flatgeobuf.org/) is a "performant binary encoding for geographic data", a single file
format that also manages to be cloud native and include a spatial index. GeoServer provides access to
this format thought the [WFS FlatGeobuf output format](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/community/flatgeobuf/index.html),
which not only can write the format, but also read it as a standard data store.

The [Vector Mosaic datastore](https://docs.geoserver.org/main/en/user/community/vector-mosaic/index.html) supports
creation of mosaics made of single file vector data, useful in situations where the access to data is
targeted to sub-pages of a larger data set (e.g., data for a single time, or a single customer, or a single data collect,
out of a very large uniform set of vectors) and the database storage for it has become either too slow, or too expensive.

These two modules make a great combo for those in need to handle very large vector datasets, by storing
the [FlatGeoBuf](https://flatgeobuf.org/) on cheap storage.

In particular, the FlatGeoBuf module saw speed improvements that made it the new "fastest vector format"
for cases where one needs to display a large data set, all at once, on screen (PostGIS remains the king
of the hill for anything that needs sophisticated filtering instead).

For reference, we have timed rendering 4 million tiny polygons out of a precision farming collect, using a 7 classes
quantile based SLDs. Here is a tiny excerpt of the map:

![Small sample out of 4 million polygons](/img/posts/2.24/flatgeobuf.png) 

And here are the timings to render the full set of polygons, putting them all on screen, at the same time, with a single GetMap request:

* PostGIS, 113 seconds
* Shapefile, 41 seconds
* Flatgeobuf, 36 seconds

The tuning is not complete, more optimizations are possible. Interested? Andrea Aime is the contact point for this work.
