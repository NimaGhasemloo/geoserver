The GeoServer development team would like to announce the release of [GeoServer 1.6.4](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/GeoServer+1.6.4).  Primarily a bugfix release, it contains over 30 [patches and improvements](http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS/fixforversion/14170) since 1.6.3.   This version contains better support for the [GeoWebCache plugin](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/geoserver/geoserver-1.6.4-gwc-plugin.zip) (if you haven't checked out [GeoWebCache](http://geowebcache.org) you [very much should](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/05/accelerate-your-maps-with-geowebcache.html).)  There is now better default formatting of KML output, including including support for paging.  The Windows installer has been updated and now has better compatibility with Windows Vista.  Also, support for [Freemarker templates](http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/) for coverage layers has been added.

You can view the full [changelog](http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GEOS/fixforversion/14170) for more details.  Thanks to everyone who submitted patches!  Please keep them coming.  I've been hearing rumors about the features planned for future releases, so exciting developments look like they are coming down the line.  Stay tuned!  (Or better yet, [get involved](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOSDOC/0.2+How+to+Help)!)
