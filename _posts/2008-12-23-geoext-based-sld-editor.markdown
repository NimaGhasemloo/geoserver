Just in time for the holiday season the GeoServer team is happy to announce the coming of a new SLD editor extension based on the newly founded [GeoExt](http://www.geoext.org/) project. [Download](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/geoserver/styler-1.7.1.zip?big_mirror=0) the new extension and try it out. It also requires the installation of the [rest plugin](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/geoserver/geoserver-1.7.1-rest-plugin.zip?big_mirror=0). A quick walk through of the installation and functionality can be found [here](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/GeoExt+Styler).

The GeoExt library is a javascript framework for building rich web based mapping applications which is built on top of the the [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org) and [Ext](http://extjs.com) libraries. The project has recently kicked itself off with the forming of a [mailing list](mailto:geoext@lists.opengeo.org), and a [call for participation](http://www.geoext.org/trac/geoext/wiki/CallParticipation).
