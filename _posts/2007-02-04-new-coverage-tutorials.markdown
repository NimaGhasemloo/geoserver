In light of our upcoming official 1.5 release, we have made a couple tutorials about Coverages to assist in the transition. For beginners, we have a [tutorial](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOSDOC/User+Tutorial+Coverage) that walks through the basic steps of adding a TIFF dataset to GeoServer. And then for the more advanced user, there is a [tutorial](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOSDOC/Load+NASA+Blue+Marble+Data) on creating and adding an image mosaic to GeoServer.




We have also updated our other documentation to tie in coverages, but if you see any gaps in the documentation or would like more information on coverages or various data formats, drop us a line here on the blog or on the mailing list.
