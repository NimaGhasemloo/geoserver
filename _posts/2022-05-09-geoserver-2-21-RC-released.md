GeoServer [2.21-RC](/release/2.21-RC/) release is now available with downloads ([bin](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.21-RC/geoserver-2.21-RC-bin.zip/download), [war](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.21-RC/geoserver-2.21-RC-war.zip/download), [windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.21-RC/GeoServer-2.21-RC-winsetup.exe/download)), along with [docs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.21-RC/geoserver-2.21-RC-htmldoc.zip/download) and [extensions](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geoserver/files/GeoServer/2.21-RC/extensions/).

This is a GeoServer release candidate made in conjunction with GeoTools 27-RC and GeoWebCache 1.21-RC.

  * Release candidates are a community building exercise and are not intended for production use.
  * We ask the community (everyone: individuals, organizations, service providers) to download and thoroughly test this release candidate and report back.
  * Testing priority is the new internationalization support
  * Participating in testing release candidates is a key expectation of our [open source social contract](http://www.ianturton.com/talks/foss4g.html#/). We make an effort to thank each person who tests in our release announcement and project presentations!
  * GeoServer [commercial service providers](http://geoserver.org/support/) are fully expected to test on behalf of their customers.

### Release Candidate Testing Priorities

We would like to ask for your assistance testing the following:

* Try out the new language chooser, and if you spot any translations you can help out with we would love your [assistance translating geoserver](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/developer/translation.html).

* The ability to customize feature types allows for a lot of creativity, please try this out and share your examples

* This release features a new Log4J logging system. If you only choose between the built-in logging profiles we expect everything to be smooth an uneventful.

  If you have made any custom logging profiles, or customized the built-in logging profiles in place, some additional care is required (see below). We are very interested in this upgrade process and ask for your feedback and testing at this time.

* For those using GDAL or OGR please check the instructions below on upgrading to GDAL 3.

A reminder that open-source is a community activity and we ask everyone to take part at this time. 

### Feature Type Customization

We are pleased to share a long-requested feature - the ability to rename attributes and change attribute order when publishing a FeatureType. 

![Feature type customization](/img/posts/2.21/feature_type_remap.png) <br/>

It is also possible to change attribute type, and with the use of ECQL expressions generate new attributes on the fly.

The above example works around the limitations of shapefile to use longer names, and creates a new attribute ``capital`` on the fly from an expression, as shown in the following GetFeatureInfo output.

![GetFeatureInfo tasmania_cities](/img/posts/2.21/tasmania_feature_type.png) <br/>

This is a great new addition to GeoServer, please see [Feture Type Details](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/webadmin/layers.html#feature-type-details-vector) in the user guide for details.

* [GEOS-10356](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-10356) Allow feature type customization

Thanks to Andrea Aime (GeoSolutions) for proposal [GSIP-207](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/wiki/GSIP-207) and implementation.

### Translations and Language Chooser

A big thanks to Alexandre Gacon and everyone who helped improve GeoServer internationalization for during this release cycle.

To support this activity Andrea Aime has contributed a language chooser to the top of the screen (near the login button).

![Language chooser](/img/posts/2.21/language.png)<br/>

For more information see [Choosing the UI language](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/webadmin/index.html#choosing-the-ui-language) (User Guide).

* [GEOS-1158](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-1158) Specify Geoserver UI Language in Configuration

### Add Styles support to LayerGroup

Layer groups can now be configured with additional styles, with each style listing a series of layers along with the style used to render each layer.

![Layer group styles](/img/posts/2.21/layer_group_styles.png) <br/>

This allows a `SINGLE` or `OPAQUE` layer group to list alternate styles in addition to the default one. Each alternate style is defined by a named configuration of layers and styles providing a unique visual representation.

In the above example the layer group Tasmania is setup with an alternate "data" presentation, presenting the content with the geoserver default styles `point`, `line` and `polygon`.

![Layer group style Tasmania](/img/posts/2.21/layer_group_tas.png) <br/>

For more information see [Layer Group Styles](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/webadmin/layergroups.html#layer-group-styles) (User Guide).

* [GEOS-10252](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-10252) Add Styles support to LayerGroup
* [GEOS-10274](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-10274) Geofence follow up LayerGroup Style addition

Thanks to Marco Volpini (GeoSolutions) for [GSIP-205](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/wiki/GSIP-205) proposal and implementation.

### GeoPackage WMS and WFS Output

The result of proposal [GSIP-206](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/wiki/GSIP-206) is the creation of the gs-geopkg-output extension packaging up the WFS and WMS output formats from the geopackage community module.

```
curl "http://localhost:8080/geoserver/wfs?service=wfs&version=2.0.0&request=GetFeature&typeNames=topp:states&outputFormat=geopkg" -o wfs.gpkg
```

For more information see [Using the GeoPackage Output Extension](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/extensions/geopkg-output/usage.html) in the user guide.

* [GEOS-10351](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-10351) \[GSIP 206\] Promote GeoPackage WFS and WMS output formats to an extension
* [GEOS-8793](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-8793) WFS 1.1.0/2.0.0 GeoPackage output wrong Coordinate Order

Thanks to David Blasby and Jody Garnett (GeoCat) for packaging up this work as an extension.

### Mark Factory Precedence

When rendering maps with lots of individual graphics, looking up the correct implementation (known as a MarkFactory) can be time consuming.

WMS Settings have new capability to filter out any mark factories not being used, and provide an order to prioritise the ones being used.

![MarkFactory precedence](/img/posts/2.21/markfactory.png)<br/>

For more information see [WMS Web Administration](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/services/wms/webadmin.html#mark-factory-precedence) (user guide).

* [GEOS-10230](https://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-10230) MarkFactory WMS rendering performance optimization

Thanks to Fernando Mino (GeoSolutions Group) for troubleshooting this performance issue, and proposal [GSIP-205](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/wiki/GSIP-204) as an optimization.

### Log4J 2 Upgrade

The assessment of [Log4Shell]({% post_url 2021-12-13-logj4-rce-statement %}) vulnerability highlighted that although GeoSever was not affected, our use of the older Log4j 1.2 was a notable risk. This discussion resulted a [small fundraising effort]({% post_url 2022-01-20-log4j-upgrade %}) and proposal to [upgrade to Log4j 2](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/wiki/GSIP-167).

The result is a small change to the user interface, listing logging profiles by name (previously the file extension was also listed).

![Log4j update](/img/posts/2.21/logging.png)<br/>

Internally this release replaces changes from Log4j 1.2 logging profiles (using ``properties`` extension) to Log4j 2 logging profiles (using ``xml`` extension):

* The built-in logging profiles (``DEFAULT_LOGGING``, ``PRODUCTION_LOGGING``, ...) are replaced with new Log4j 2 ``xml`` files.

* Previous custom logging profiles will continue to be available (Log4J 2 has the ability to read the older Log4J 1.2 properties files).

* If you made any customizations to the built-in profiles, you can recover your changes from backup ``bak`` file. You can use this backup as a reference when creating a new ``xml`` logging profile, or restore this under a different name which does not conflict with the built-in logging profiles.

  A customization to ``PRODUCTION_LOGGING.properties`` will be backed up to ``PRODUCTION_LOGGING.properties.bak``. This can be restored by renaming ``PRODUCTION_LOGGING.properties.bak`` to ``CUSTOM_LOGGING.properties``.

In addition to the ``INFO`` status messages, you will notice a new ``CONFIG`` logging level used during application startup:
```
CONFIG [org.geoserver] - GeoServer configuration lock is enabled
CONFIG [org.geoserver] - Loading catalog...
...
```

For more information, and examples of writing on log4J 2 profile, see [Logging Settings](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/configuration/globalsettings.html#logging-settings) and [Advanced log configuration](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/configuration/logging.html) in the User Guide. Of note is the introduction of a new ``CONFIG`` logging level used loading and saving configuration changes.
