I am pleased to announce that we are organizing a "[Birds of a Feather](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_2009_BirdsOfAFeather#INSPIRE_Data_Profile_Support_in_FOSS4G)" session ([what's that?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_Feather_(computing))) at the [FOSS4G 2009](http://2009.foss4g.org/) Conference in Sydney, Australia.  This session is to gather together everyone who is interested in discussing the past, present, and (bright) future of GeoServer.

The session will be held on **Thursday 22nd October, late afternoon** (specific time TBD).  If you are attending FOSS4G 2009 (and [you very much should](http://blog.geoserver.org/2009/07/23/geoserver-is-all-over-foss4g/)), feel free to stop by in order to say hi and chat a bit with us.

See you there!
