Several new features are included in this release:

* GetFeatureInfo can now includes ColorMap labels for the location clicked, check out the [tutorial](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/tutorials/GetFeatureInfo/raster.html).
* A new styling vendor option `inclusion` to [control control legend generation](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/styling/sld/extensions/rendering-selection.html) for WMS GetLegendGraphic using values of `legendOnly`, `mapOnly`, or `normal` to define how a style element is used.

Notable improvements:

* Customization of complex GeoJSON WFS output is now available for other data stores, previously this was restricted attributes marked ``@dataType`` by the AppSchema plugin.
- SLD Service now places a limit, configured by system variable ``-Dorg.geoserver.sldService.maxUniqueRange=1024`, of the number of unique intervals.

Fixes included in this release:
