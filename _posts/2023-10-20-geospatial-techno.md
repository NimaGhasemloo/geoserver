### What is Service?

A collection of operations, accessible through an interface, that allows a user to invoke a behavior of value to the user.

#### What are Web Services?

Web services are internet-based applications that can perform a wide range of functions, from simple tasks to complex business processes.

#### What are GeoSpatial Web Services?

GeoSpatial web services are online platforms that offer access to and analyze geographical information. They aim to overcome the lack of compatibility between different geospatial systems.

#### Why do you need standard web services?

Standard web services provide a common platform for communication between modern-day business applications that use different programming languages. This enables convenient interaction regardless of development language.

### What is OGC?

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international organization that promotes the use of open standards to make geospatial information and services to be "FAIR", which stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. This goal applies to various areas such as data sharing, data processing, sensor web, and the Internet of Things.

#### What are OGC Web Services?

OGC Web Services (OWS) are a set of standards that allow for seamless integration of various online geoprocessing and location services. With OWS, users can access and utilize services such as the Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Coverage Service (WCS), and Web Map Tile Service (WMTS).

WMS enables users to retrieve and obtain detailed information on maps of geospatial data. WFS allows for data manipulation operations on geographic features, including querying, creating, modifying, and deleting features. WCS provides access to raster datasets like elevation models and remote sensing imagery. WMTS serves pre-rendered or computed map tiles over the internet.

These services provide an interoperable framework for accessing, integrating, analyzing, and visualizing online geodata sources, sensor-derived information, and geoprocessing capabilities.

### What is GeoServer?

GeoServer is a Java-based server that allows users to view and edit geospatial data. Using open standards set forth by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), GeoServer allows for great flexibility in map creation and data sharing.

#### Open and Share Your Spatial Data

GeoServer is a powerful open-source tool for displaying spatial information through maps in various formats. The tool integrates OpenLayers, a free mapping library, for easy and quick map generation. Moreover, It supports standards like WMS, WFS, WCS, and WMTS, enabling data sharing, editing, and easy integration with web and mobile applications.
With modular functionality and extensions, GeoServer offers extensive processing options. For example, the Web Processing Service (WPS) extension provides a wide range of processing options, and users can even create their extensions.

#### Use Free and Open Source Software

GeoServer is a free and open-source software that brings down the financial barrier to using GIS products. It is released every six months with new features, bug fixes, and improvements, providing a quick turnaround time. This transparent process often leads to faster advancements compared to closed software solutions. By using GeoServer, organizations can avoid software lock-in and save money on support contracts in the future.

#### Integrate With Mapping APIs

GeoServer is a versatile software that can integrate with popular mapping applications like Google Maps and Microsoft Bing Maps. It can also connect with traditional GIS architectures such as ESRI ArcGIS. OpenLayers and Leaflet are recommended as complementary tools to GeoServer for web mapping needs.

#### Join the Community

GeoServer has an active global community of users and developers, offering support through email lists. The software has a fixed release cycle and public issue tracker, ensuring transparency and regular updates. Commercial support is also available. Overall, using GeoServer means being part of a supportive community.
