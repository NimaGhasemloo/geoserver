I just wanted to give a quick hello to those in the wider world working  on GeoServer.  The [GeoServer website](http://geoserver.org) recently got a bump in network  traffic, and when we investigated, we saw it was directed by a group in Russia called [GIS-Lab](http://gis-lab.info), who have an [introduction to using GeoServer](http://gis-lab.info/qa/geoserver-begin.html) on their site. ([Google translation](http://www.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgis-lab.info%2Fqa%2Fgeoserver-begin.html&langpair=ru%7Cen&hl=en&ie=UTF8))

Also, if you are a faithful reader of this blog, you'll notice that  [Fernando Quadro](http://www.fernandoquadro.com.br) often paraphrases [some of our posts](http://www.fernandoquadro.com.br/html/2008/04/09/geoserver-163-released) in Portuguese.  There is a [GeoServer mailing list in Portuguese](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/geoserver/) as well.  Earlier this month, the GeoServer website was “slashdotted” by [Slashdot Japan](http://slashdot.jp/it/article.pl?sid=08/04/17/2115221) regarding a company which is using  OpenLayers, GeoServer, and GeoWebCache.

We currently have local translations for our web interface in Japanese,  Chinese, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish.  We're always looking  for people to write more localizations as well (please see our website for information on how to [localize GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOSDOC/How+to+Localize+GeoServer)).  We're eventually looking to have  the core of our documentation translated as well.

This is all very promising, as it shows that the need for an open-source  mapping framework is a worldwide desire, transcending the boundaries of  nation and language.  We have set up a page denoting these [international resources](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOSDOC/International+Resources).  If you know of other GeoServer blogs, mailing  lists, or other websites that we may not be aware of, please [add them](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOSDOC/International+Resources) to that page, as we would love to know about them.
