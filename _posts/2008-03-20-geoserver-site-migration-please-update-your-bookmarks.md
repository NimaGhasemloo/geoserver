Many of you have likely noticed that the main GeoServer site is migrating from [docs.codehaus.org](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOS) to the much easier to remember [geoserver.org](http://geoserver.org).  This has been a long running process, that we're finally approaching the end of.  We were hoping to have automatic redirection from the old site to the new, but are waiting on a task to be done on the codehaus server (you may be able to help by [voting on the issue](http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/HAUS-1643) - follow the link and if you have a jira account you should be able to click a link to vote).  If that doesn't happen then we will likely delete those spaces in a month or two, so please update your bookmarks to the documentation now, so that they continue to work.  Note the structure of the pages is exactly the same as the old, so if there is a page like [http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOS/Roadmap](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GEOS/Roadmap) the new location will be [http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Roadmap](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Roadmap).
