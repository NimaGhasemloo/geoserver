## Security Considerations


This release addresses three security vulnerabilities:



 	
  * Added a [configurable delay](http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/security/webadmin/auth.html#brute-force-attack-prevention) during login, to mitigate a brute force attack.

 	
  * Added a [configurable parameter](http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/production/config.html#x-frame-options-policy) to control clickjacking attacks against the GeoServer UI.

 	
  * Added an additional parameter for locking down password autocomplete in the GeoServer UI


Thanks to Andrea Aime and Devon Tucker for providing fixes to these issues.

These fixes are also included in the 2.11.1 release.
