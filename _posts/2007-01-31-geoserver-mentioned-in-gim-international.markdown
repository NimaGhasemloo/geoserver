The GIS magazine [GIM International](http://www.gim-international.com) has an article about GeoServer that summarizes up our development process and features really well. It also takes a good look at the previous year's development efforts and what you can expect to see in the future. Take a look at the article [here](http://www.gim-international.com/issues/articles/id850-True_Spirit_of_Open_Source.html).
