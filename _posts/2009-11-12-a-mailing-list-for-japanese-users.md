After a nice showing at the [FOSS4G Tokyo](http://www.osgeo.jp/foss4g2009-in-tokyo/) and [Osaka](http://www.osgeo.jp/foss4g2009-in-osaka/) conferences we decided the time had come for a new GeoServer language users mailing list.  Taking advantage of the fact that GeoServer just [got accepted to OSGeo](http://blog.geoserver.org/2009/11/09/geoserver-accepted-to-osgeo-incubation/) incubation the new list is on the OSGeo infrastructure, at [http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/geoserver-jp](http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/geoserver-jp) The mailing list is a resource for those who would like assistance in all things GeoServer, but prefer to discuss in Japanese.  This marks the sixth language mailing list for GeoServer.  We're hoping soon the community gets a translation of the new UI, and some Japanese docs as well.
